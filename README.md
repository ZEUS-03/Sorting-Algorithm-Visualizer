# sorting-algorithm-visualizer

## Introduction:

- This project is based on the idea of visualization of common sorting algorithms such as:

	- Bubble sort
	- Insertion sort
	- Merge sort
	- Quick sort
	- Selection sort

- This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- The purpose of making this project was to help students and Professionals gain proper and better understanding of how sorting algorithm works.

## Structure:

- HTML and CSS are used for designing basic frontend. Also Bootstrap is used for nav bar and buttons present in nav bar.

- JavaScript is extensively used for DOM manipulation.(such as creating new bars and replacing bars to visualize sorting pattern)

- I have also provided speed and size of array buttons to control the speed of the sorting visualization and also the size of the displayed array(or bars).

- Each sorting algorithm has its button allocated specifically.
